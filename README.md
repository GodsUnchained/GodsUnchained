- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GodsUnchained
- ðŸ‘€ Gods Unchained is a free-to-play tactical card game that gives players true ownership of their in-game items. Led by the former game director of Magic The Gathering: Arena, the game focuses on competitive play, which means players must strategically outsmart their opponents by building decks that are able to combat a wide variety of tactics.
In Gods Unchained players completely own their digital items, giving them the freedom to trade, sell and use their cards any way they like â€“ just like owning real, tangible cards.
